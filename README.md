# PID-control-speed-DC-motor
This project only simulation that using tinkercad, focusing on how code PID into Arduino or any microcontroller with ArduinoIDE without library
You can tuning PID in any available way such as:
1. Ziegler Nichols
2. Manually,
3. Software such as MATLAB/Simulink, LabVIEW, or others.
